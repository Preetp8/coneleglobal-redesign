Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
*   npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo (replace `your_username/your_repository.git` with the actual URL):
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd coneleglobal-redesign
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the app in the development mode:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server after a build.
*   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to analyze the code for potential errors and style issues.

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the key directories:

*   `public/`: Contains static assets like images (e.g., `logo.png`) and SVGs.
*   `src/`: Contains the core source code of the application.
    *   `components/`: Reusable React components (e.g., `Navbar.jsx`, `Footer.js`).
    *   `pages/`: Next.js pages, where each file corresponds to a route (e.g., `index.jsx` is the homepage).
    *   `styles/`: Global styles and CSS files.
    *   `App.jsx`: The main application component, likely setting up routing.
    *   `main.jsx`: The entry point for the React application (though in Next.js, `_app.js` or `_app.jsx` in `pages` is typically the main wrapper).
*   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
*   `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
*   `next.config.js`: Configuration file for Next.js (Note: This file was not listed in the initial `ls` but is standard for Next.js projects; if specific configurations are present, they would be here).
